# Stations

Stations are the places where you will buy, sell, and trade resources. When you get in range, you can 
use your action for the turn to [trade](trading.html) with the station.
The stations will take the primary imports and use them to produce the stated output.
In addition, the secondary product will help speed up the production.

Note: the Black Market Stations and the Secure Station don't have imports or produce anything; they only sell modules. With the exception that Black Markets will also purchase illegal salvage.
