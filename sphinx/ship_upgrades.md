# Ship Upgrades

## List of Upgrades
There are 7 different upgrades a ship can have:
* `Hull Strength` - How much damage you can take
* `Engine Speed` - How fast your ship moves in one action
* `Weapon Damage` - How powerful the weapon is
* `Weapon Range` - How far away your ship can attack enemies
* `Cargo Space` - How much space your ship has to store items
* `Mining Yield` - How fast your ship can mine
* `Sensor Range` - How far your ship's sensors can detect ships

## How To Upgrade
To purchase upgrades, go to the center station and use the `buy_module` function.
For any upgrade, you must purchase an additional slot for the upgrade from the selling stations.
- For upgrade levels 1 and 2, these are purchasable at the `Station Authority` station.
- For upgrade levels 3, these are purchasable at the `***** ****** [!/@]` stations.
  - Be warned, these are the illegal modules. They are lost on death and will cost you notoriety.
