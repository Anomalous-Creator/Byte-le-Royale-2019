# Installing

## Introduction
The installation process has been streamlined from previous years. The application
has the bonuses of update notification, an enclosed runtime environment, and a help
function to assist in starting up the components.

## Requirements
In order for the game to work, the following steps must be taken:
1. Ensure that your Python version is at least 3.5 or higher
  - This can be checked by typing `python --version` in a terminal / command prompt
2. Download the launcher zip file from [Here](), unzip the folder, and enter that folder in the terminal.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the command prompt to install the required packages.

From there, you can [get started](getting_started.md) with creating your AI.
