# Overview

Congratulations! If you are reading this, you are the newest member of the `Pilots Federation`!
This means that you will soon begin competing against others to see who is the best pilot in the sector.
Before you begin, please take note of the following concepts:

## Getting Started

You can [get started with this link](getting_started.html), or read on for more information.

## Your Ship

Your ship is your vessel of action in the game. You control a singular ship (that respawns on death), and through your ship, you make trades, mine resources, or engage in combat.
[More Information Here](ships.html)

## Modules

As your ship earns more money, you can get modules to upgrade your ship at black market stations or the secure station. These can range from more hull strength, to increased speed, to more cargo space, and more.
Find out more about modules [here](ship_upgrades.html)

## Stations and Trading

At stations, you can buy and sell resources. The prices can vary by station.
[Station info here](stations.html) and [trading info here](trading.html)

## Mining

Mining is done in asteroid fields on the map. By mining at the asteroid field, you gain the raw resources for free, at the cost of the time it takes to mine.
[More information here](asteroid_fields_and_mining.html)

## Combat

If you desire to be a fighter more than a trader, you can then be either a pirate or a bounty hunter.
[Bounty hunter and pirate info here](bounty_hunting_lawfulness_and_piracy.html) and [general combat info here](combat.html)

## Initial Funding

You will start out 1000 credits. These credits are used to buy and sell other resources and modules.

## Scoring

At the end of the game, whoever has the most credits at the end is the winner.
There are additional accolades for various tasks which are purely for bragging rights (most kills, most upgrades, most mined, etc).
