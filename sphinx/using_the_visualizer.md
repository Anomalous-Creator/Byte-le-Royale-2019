# Using the Visualizer

## How the Visualizer Works

The visualizer takes the log generated from the server after the client is run and uses it to step through the game visually.
The visualizer is invoked by running `br_launcher.pyz visualizer`.

## Keyboard shortcuts

* `p` - pause the visualizer
* `f` - fullscreen mode (Windows quirks may prevent consistently working)
* `escape` - quit the visualizer
* `s` - stats screen
* `1` - Lists primary material buy price by station
* `2` - Lists secondary material buy price by station
* `3` - Material sell price by station
* `4` - Material Buy vs Sell
* `5` - Material Production vs Consumption
* `Shift-Up`: Disable interpolation.
* `Shift-Down`: Enable interpolation. Results in smoother flight paths but runs slower on windows.
* **Click on station** - Station statistics
