# Combat

Combat is a common occurrence in space, whether you initiate it or get attacked. Combat occurs simultaneously to allow
both ships to destroy each other in the same step. 

To attack another ship, call `self.attack(ship_to_attack)`, where `ship_to_attack` is the target. If the target is in range, you will attack them.
