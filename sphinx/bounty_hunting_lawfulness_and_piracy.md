# Bounty Hunting, Lawfulness, and Piracy

## Introduction

In the violent galaxy, people work hard and fight for their pay. Some of these jobs are more legal than others. This page describes the legality of certain jobs, and how it pertains to your chances at living. 

## Bounty Hunting

Bounty hunters are the lawless law officers. They will go outside the law to stop pirates and are on the good side of the Notoriety Scale.

## Lawfulness

Lawfulness is measured by the `ship.notoriety` statistic, showing how good or evil a player is. A higher notoriety means a player is less lawful and more aggressive.

If notoriety increases, police ships will chase the player when nearby the central station.
If your notoriety goes too high, you will be labeled a pirate.
Pirates are forbidden to access the Secure Station and a radius around the secure station.
Any pirates within the Secure Zone, will be fired upon by the police.
Additionally, citizens and bounty hunters are free to hunt down pirates without fear of reprisal from law enforcement.
If private citizens, bounty hunters and police are unable to curb an especially menacing pirate, Enforcers may be sent out in waves to bring the pirate ship down.

## Piracy

Piracy is a simple way of getting money at the expense of others. Pirates not only get the benefit of ill-begotten goods sellable at black market stations, but they also can buy extremely powerful illicit modules from the same stations.

## Police

The police are AI ships that are sent to take out pirates and other notorious vehicles. If your notoriety is above a certain threshold, the police will begin to attack if in range of the central station or a scout / patrol ship.
In addition, if your notoriety goes too high, enforcers will be sent out to destroy you. They are even more powerful police ships, and will give chase until you or themselves are destroyed.
