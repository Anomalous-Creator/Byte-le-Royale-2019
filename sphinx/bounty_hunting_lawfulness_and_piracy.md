# Bounty Hunting, Lawfulness, and Piracy

## Introduction

Space can be a lawless wasteland, where anything and everything goes. However, around here, we have the police to protect from pirates, pirates who wish to take what they can, bounty hunters to stop the pirates, and a notoriety system to keep track of it all.

## Bounty Hunting

Bounty hunters are the lawless law officers. They will go outside the law to stop pirates.

## Pirates

Pirates are the ships that decide to take what they want from other ships by destroying civilian and pirate ships.

## Police

The police are AI ships that will slowly ramp up in strength depending on the target. If your notoriety is above a certain threshold, the police will begin to attack if in range.

## Notoriety

Your notoriety can change depending on the following circumstances:

* Ways to increase notoriety:
  * Destroy Civilians -- +0

  * Destroy Police -- +2
  * Destroy Enforcer -- +3
