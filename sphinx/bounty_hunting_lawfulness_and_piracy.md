# Bounty Hunting, Lawfulness, and Piracy

## Introduction

In the violent galaxy, people work hard and fight for their pay. Some of these jobs are more legal than others. This page describes the legality of certain jobs, and how it pertains to your chances at living. 

## Bounty Hunting

Bounty hunters are the lawless law officers. They will go outside the law to stop pirates and be seen as 'the good guys'.

## Lawfulness

Lawfulness is measured by the Notoriety statistic, showing how good or evil a player is. A higher notoriety means a player is less lawful and more aggressive.

If notoriety increases, police ships will chase the player when nearby the central station. Should it become too high, bounty hunters may start hunting the player for reward, and enforcers may be sent out to deal with the player.

## Piracy

Piracy is a simple way of getting monetary gains at the expense of others. Pirates not only get the benefit of ill-begotten goods sellable at black market stations, but they also can buy extremely powerful illicit upgrades from the same stations.

## Police

The police are AI ships that are sent to take out pirates and other notorious vehicles. If your notoriety is above a certain threshold, the police will begin to attack if in range of the central station or a scout / patrol ship.
In addition, if your notoriety goes too high, enforcers will be sent out to destroy you. They are even more powerful police ships, and will give chase until you or themselves are destroyed.
