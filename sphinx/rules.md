# Competition Rules

There are two sections of rules for this event: Competition Rules and Event Rules.
ALL rules are to be followed, and if something comes up that is not covered by the rules, the 
ACM retains the right to review and rule on a case-by-case basis.

## Event Rules

1. Respect your fellow competitors and do not disrupt or otherwise interfere with them.
2. Keep your area clean.
3. No forming alliances with other teams (i.e. the teams involved all write their AI to assist each other)
4. Maintain appropriate behavior throughout the event and on any forms of communication used therein.
5. Any attempts to disrupt, interfere, or otherwise adversely affect any aspect of the event will result in a disqualification, including, but not limited to:
  * Forums
  * Scrimmage Server
  * Event staff
  * Other competitors

##Competition Rules

Note: there is no 'right' or 'wrong' way to write your AI. There are however some important rules to follow:

* ONLY the following imports are allowed:
  * math
  * itertools
  * collections
  * random
  * game.common.enums
  * game.client.user_client
  
  Usage of any other import will not allow your code to run on the scrimmage server.
* Do not attempt to collect information on your opponent's ship that can't be directly observed.
* Do not attempt to access the game's source code.
* Avoid processes and procedures that will take an abnormally long time per turn. If the time to take a turn becomes too long, your ship will automatically take a turn.
* If you are unsure of an action, first check the documentation.
  If the documented output does not match the expected output,
  please contact an event staff member to determine what potential problem has arisen and how to fix it.
* The code written must be your own (don't copy/paste code from other competitors)
