# Writing Your AI

There is no right or wrong way to write your AI. There are however a few things to take note of:

* Except for the built-in libraries, no imports.
* Do not attempt to collect information on your opponent's ship that can't be directly observed.
* Avoid processes and procedures that will take an abnormally long time per turn. If the time to take a turn becomes too long, your ship will automatically take a turn.
