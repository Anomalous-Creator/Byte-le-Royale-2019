# 3D Visualizer
While the game does come with a package pygame (2d) visualizer [we also developed a 3d visualizer in unity to acompany the game](https://github.com/jghibiki/Byte-le-Royale-2019-Visualizer). The 3d visualizer was run on a scrimmage sever which contestants submitted their clients to in order to have them run against other compeditor's clients.

# Install Dependencies
Note: the following instructions are verified to work for installing Python 3.7 on Windows. If the installation is done in a different way, you may not be able to properly run the program.
1. Install Python 3.7 (use `python --version` to see which version you are running). Make sure to custom install for all
users and that the box to add Python to $PATH (if you do not add it to $PATH, you can not directly invoke Python 
in the command prompt)
2. Install pipenv from [https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/), following their instructions.
3. After installing pipenv, run the following command to install dependencies: `pipenv install`
